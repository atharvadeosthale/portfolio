I'm writing this on a night, or probably morning, I'm not sure, it's 5:19 AM, you can decide for yourself. I purchased the Claude Max subscription just minutes ago and decided a good prompt would be to add a blog section on my website. If you're really following my journey, you probably know I've been using [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com) for my blog posts, but that changes from now on. Let's see why.

**TL;DR:** No beef at all. Hashnode is great, but I want more control over my content. Now that I can just write a prompt to quickly change stuff on my website, I can easily build a blog. It's not like I cannot do that myself without AI, it's just that I was lazy to do so before. Now it's not the case.

## Why not Hashnode?

Hashnode is amazing. It's a great platform for everyone to get started with blogging. If you don't know what Hashnode is, it's a blogging platform mainly focusing on developers. It has a community around it, which was really strong when I created my blog on Hashnode. However, over the months and years, the community has gotten weaker (?) and I have not seen many of people in my circle using it anymore, so I've decided to move on.

Hashnode has amazing features and all, but I can just build those myself with the help of AI now. And technically, doing that gives me more control and flexibility.

## Why am I inactive?

I used to write blogs quite often long ago, around 2020-2022, but then I stopped, and never gave an explanation. I moved my focus towards video content, specifically YouTube. Even my day job revolves upon developer-focused video content. I've found video content to be more fun, engaging and "bringing more opportunities" for me, especially now, when most blog posts by people are AI generated.

## My plans for this blog

I am not going to be lying and saying this is going to be an active blog, but I will try to post every once in a while when I have some learnings to share, both technical and non-technical. Currently no way to subscribe to this blog, but I will announce new blogs on my socials for now, and add newest blog posts on the homepage. Currently not doing it, just want to see if the blog is really useful or not.

## Closing thoughts

I'm excited to start this new blog. If you have any ideas for content to post on here, or if you want to be a guest author (the blog supports that), please reach out to me on [my socials](https://links.atharva.codes) or [email me](mailto:hey@atharva.codes). I know not many people will do that haha, but I can only try.
